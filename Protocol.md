# Agar.io Protocol

Note that a lot of the documentation here is just guesswork for the time being. As work progresses on Ogar, my open-source Agar.io server implementation (creative name, I know), this documentation will be updated further.

## Data Types
Agar.io uses standard JavaScript DataView data types, for the most part. *Note that in contrast to standard DataView behavior, all multi-byte values are encoded across the wire as little endian.* This table is a reference of some of the commonly used data types.

| Data Type | Description 
|-----------|-----------
| uint8     | Unsigned 1 byte integer (byte)
| uint16    | Unsigned 2 byte integer (short)
| uint32    | Unsigned 4 byte integer (int)
| float32   | Signed 4 byte floating point value (float)
| float64   | Signed 8 byte floating point value (double)
| string    | Null-terminated UTF-16 string (2 bytes per character)
| boolean   | uint8 where 0 = false, 1 = true

Each packet starts with a uint8 containing the packet ID.

## Clientbound Packets
### Packet 16: Update Nodes
Sent to the client by the server to update information about one or more nodes. Nodes to be destroyed are placed at the beginning of the node data list.

| Position | Data Type     | Description
|----------|---------------|-----------------
| 0        | uint8         | Packet ID
| 1        | uint16        | Number of nodes to be destroyed
| 3...?    | Node Data     | Data for all nodes
| ?        | uint32        | Always 0; terminates the node data listing
| ?        | uint16        | Always 0; discarded by the client
| ?        | uint32        | Number of nodes marked for destroying
| ?...?    | uint32        | Node ID of each destroyed node

#### Node Data
Each visible node is described by the following data. This data repeats n times at the end of the Update Nodes packet, where n is the number specified by position 1 in the packet (number of nodes).

| Offset | Data Type | Description
|--------|-----------|-------------------
| 0      | uint32    | Node ID
| 4      | uint16    | X position
| 6      | uint16    | Y position
| 8      | uint16    | Size
| 10     | uint8     | Color (Red component)
| 11     | uint8     | Color (Green component)
| 12     | uint8     | Color (Blue component)
| 13     | uint8     | Flags - see below
|        |           | Skip a specific number of bytes based on the flags field. See below.
| ?      | string    | Node name
| ?      | uint16    | End of string

The flags field is 1 byte in length, and is a bitfield. If no flag that specifies the offset is set, 0 bytes will be skipped. Here's a table describing the known behaviors of setting specific flags:

| Bit | Behavior
|-----|------------------
| 1   | If set, the node is a virus
| 2   | Advance offset after flags by 4 bytes
| 5   | Agitated Virus
| 4   | Advance offset after flags by 8 bytes
| 8   | Advance offset after flags by 16 bytes

Node data that is marked for destruction has a simpler format:

| Offset | Data Type | Description
|--------|-----------|-------------------
| 0      | uint32    | Node ID of killing cell
| 4      | uint32    | Node ID of killed cell

### Packet 17: Update Position and Size

| 9        | float32   | Size
